# **0x0C. C - More malloc, free**

## **Concepts**

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

>
> - <span style="color:red;">[Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/62)</span>

# **Resources**
### *Read or watch:**
>
> - <span style="color:red;">[Do I cast the result of malloc?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc)</span>

### **man or help:**

>
> - <span style="color:red;">exit (3) </span>
> - <span style="color:red;">calloc </span>
> - <span style="color:red;">realloc </span>

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <span style="color:red;"> explain to anyone </span>, **without the help of Google:**

# **General**

>
> - How to use the <span style="color:red;">exit</span> function
> - What are the functions <span style="color:red;">calloc</span> and <span style="color:red;"> realloc</span> from the standard library and how to use them

# **Requirements**

## **General**

>
> - Allowed editors: <span style="color:red;"> vi, vim, emacs</span>
> - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using <span style="color:red;"> gcc </span>, using the options <span style="color:red;"> -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</span>
> - All your files should end with a new line
> - A <span style="color:red;">README.md</span> file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
> - Your code should use the<span style="color:red;"> Betty</span> style. It will be checked using<span style="color:red;"> betty-style.pl</span> and <span style="color:red;"> betty-doc.pl</span>
> - You are not allowed to use global variables
> - No more than 5 functions per file
> - The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
> - You are allowed to use _putchar
> - You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
> - In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
> - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
> - Don’t forget to push your header file
