## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without using Google:

### General

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- You must come up with solutions for the tasks to meet the learning objectives.
- Copying and pasting someone else’s work is not allowed.
- You cannot publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

  - `O(1)`
  - `O(n)`
  - `O(n!)`
  - `n*m -> O(nm)`
  - `n square -> O(n^2)`
  - `sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))`
  - `log(n) -> O(log(n))`
  - `n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))`
