# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <span style ="color:red; " > [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) </span>,**without the help of Google:**

# **General**

>
> - What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
> - What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it <span style="color:red;">ar, </spna> <span style="color:red;">rainlib, </spna> <span style="color:red;">nm, </spna>

# **Copyright - Plagiarism**

>
> - You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
> - You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
> - You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
> - Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# **Requirements**

# **C**

>
> - Allowed editors:<span style =color:red;"> vi</span>,<span style="color:red;"> vim </span>,<span style= color:red;"> emacs</span> 
> - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using <span style=color:red;"> gcc </span>, using the options <span style=color:red;"> -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 </span>
> - All your files should end with a new line
> - A <span style=color:red;"> README.md  </span> file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
> - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using <span style=color:red;"> betty-style.pl </span> and <span style=color:red;"> betty-doc.pl</span>
> - You are not allowed to use global variables
> - No more than 5 functions per file
> - You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like <span style = color:red;"> printf</span>,<span style =color:red;"> puts</span>, etc… is forbidden
> - You are allowed to use _putchar
> - You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into accoun
> - In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
> - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
> - Don’t forget to push your header file

# **bash**

>
> - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
> - All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
> - All your files should end with a new line (why?)
> - The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
> - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
> - All your files must be executable

# **More Info**

You do not need to learn about dynamic libraries, yet.
